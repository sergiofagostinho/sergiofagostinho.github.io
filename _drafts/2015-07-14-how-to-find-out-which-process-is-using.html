Imagine that an unknown process is using port 8080 and you need to find out which one is it.<br /><br />On Linux (and probably other UNIX-like operating systems you can do the following:<br /><br /><pre>lsof -i :8080<br /></pre><br /><br />On Windows you can do the following (well, assuming that you have the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">grep </span>available, for instance installing <a href="https://msysgit.github.io/" target="_blank">Git Bash</a> and adding it's&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cmd </span>directory to your <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">PATH</span>&nbsp;environment variable):<br /><br /><pre>netstat -nabo | grep :8080</pre>
