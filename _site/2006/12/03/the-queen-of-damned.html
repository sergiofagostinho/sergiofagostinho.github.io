    <span style="font-style: italic;">After six thousand years of horrifying stillness, Akasha, mother of all vampires and Queen of the Damned, has risen from her sleep to let loose the powers of the night.</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://images.bol.de/images-adb/25/7c/257c7b95-83fa-4fe7-a404-022e34f31bbf.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://images.bol.de/images-adb/25/7c/257c7b95-83fa-4fe7-a404-022e34f31bbf.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The vampire chronicles continue</span><br /><br />This third book directly continues the second book (see my <a href="http://sergioag.blogspot.com/2006/10/vampire-lestat.html">post</a>), so this is a must after reading/buying the 'Vampire Lestat'. However, unlike the previous books which were centered in the tale of one character (Louis and Lestat, respectively), this one has a different structure. We start of with an introduction by Lestat and then we are presented with the background story of most characters in the book (most of them appeared or are mentioned in the previous books). Finally, the action continues with Lestat after encountering Akasha and the remaining characters as they are told yet another tale.<br />This book is very nice, as you get to see lots of characters from various places and times all together at the same time. And as a bonus, you get a deeper understanding of Anne Rice's universe: new vampire powers, the vampire origin (which was hinted in the second book, but was not fully confirmed) and the existence of witchcraft (which is a source for some of Anne Rice's books).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Film vs. Book</span><br /><br />Unlike "Interview with the Vampire", the "Queen of the Damned" film is quite different from the book. The first (obvious) difference is that the movie condenses the second and third book (since you need the second to understand the third), which is a big mistake. Telling the book in a movie would be complicated, telling <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> books was insane: most of the historical and mythological story is lost. While there are comprehensible differences between book and movie (as these two have different structures and timing), there are some which are quite bad: Akasha's immunity to the sun, the flight ability that every vampire has, the romantic relation between Jesse and Lestat, etc.<br />Having sad that, the film is not a complete loss. It is entertaining, and the fact that they adapted the 80's rock to 90's metal was a very nice move. It is not as good as the first movie, but it's worth the popcorn :)<br /><br />I have just bought "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_%28vampire%29">Pandora</a>" (New Tales of the Vampires),  but I am unsure if I'm going to wait until finishing the Vampires Chronicles (seven books to go...).<br /><br />Until next time, may you enjoy waking up the dead.
