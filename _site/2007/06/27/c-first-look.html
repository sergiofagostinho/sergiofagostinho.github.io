    I have recently started working with the C# programming language and the .Net framework.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The language (C#)</span><br /><br />I started off with the notion that C# was Microsoft's version of Java, but that was it. After spending a weekend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-C-Second-Tom-Archer/dp/0735616485/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0164547-5406305?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182599585&amp;sr=8-1">Inside C#</a>, I got a pretty good idea on the language. My impression is that C# philosophy is quite different than Java's. While Java aims at being an elegant, minimalist language, with each new version making few changes in the Java platform; C# is a somewhat more programmer-friendly language, with as many bells and whistles  as possible (this is actually a reflex of the different backgrounds and philosophies between Sun Microsystems and Microsoft).<br />As such, here are some things I liked about C#:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">smart properties</span> - it was about time someone recognized getters and setters as first class constructs;</li><li>overriding the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">[]</span>' brackets - this little <span style="font-style: italic;">syntactic sugar</span> trick can make source code a lot easier and intuitive to read, by allowing that any class can work as an array;</li><li>structs - while this may seem not very Object-Oriented, it works well through the unified type model, since it is basically syntactic sugar for a class design pattern for storing data (no wonder it is a pending <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=723c5e413f1c54ffffffffd2a1ed73b3b5713:YfiG?bug_id=4820062">RFE for Java</a>);</li><li><span style="font-family: courier new;">unsigned</span> number types - correctly typed variables are very important;</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">delegates</span> - while not strictly necessary, it is a nice alternative to Java's anonymous classes;</li><li>mandatory <span style="font-family: courier new;">break</span> statement in each <span style="font-family: courier new;">case</span> - while a small detail, this little rule eliminates a lot of nasty bugs using the <span style="font-family: courier new;">switch</span> statement;</li></ul>On the other hand, there are other things which I didn't like at all:<br /><ul><li>polymorphism - having the possibility of defining methods which are not dynamically dispatched when overridden is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span> idea, since it basically breaks one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">substitution principle</a>.</li><li>no <span style="font-family: courier new;">throws</span> clause - big mistake there, sure you can use the <span style="color: black; font-family: courier new;">&lt;exception&gt;</span> tag on documentation, but you <span style="font-weight: bold;">don't</span> have to, and still think that the best documentation is the source code itself;</li><li>the <span style="font-family: courier new;">goto</span> statement - I'm not dogmatic about this, but come on, even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28book%29">Kerninghan and Ritchie</a> recognized that you really don't need this;</li><li><span style="font-family: courier new;">ref</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new;">out</span> keywords - while this may be useful sometimes, I think it is a bad programming technique: methods should only return one value, period. If you need more than one, then you either need a new class to group these objects, or you are designing your class wrong;</li><li>XML documentation - this was <span style="font-weight: bold;">almost</span> a good idea. While it interesting to produce XML documentation, it is too verbose to read and write. They could have done something like javadocs and parsed it into XML, for transformation and documentation support.</li><li>overriding <span style="font-style: italic;">casts</span> - maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem like a good idea...</li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The environment (Visual Studio)</span><br /><br />Regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_studio#Visual_Studio_2005">Visual Studio 2005</a> (.Net 2.0), there are a couple of things I would like to point out:<br /><ul><li>Auto completion works pretty well, including some new tricks, like completing parametric classes correctly.</li><li>Refactoring support is nice, but not as good as Eclipse.</li><li>Some source code options would be appreciated (namely automatic creation of constructors and getters/setters).</li><li>Produced documentation is a little too colourful and clumsy. Keep it simple. Take a look at Javadocs.</li></ul>Until next time, may you enjoy joining the dark side (of software development).
