If you use Microsoft Office, there are a couple of interesting add-ins which I find interesting.<br /><ul><li>"<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4D951911-3E7E-4AE6-B059-A2E79ED87041&amp;displaylang=en">2007 Microsoft Office Add-in: Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS</a>". This provides one of the features which find very annoying not to be in the main product (and one of the cool features on OpenOffice): PDF export support. No need for third party tools such as <a href="http://www.primopdf.com/">PrimoPDF</a>. By the way, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Paper_Specification">XPS</a> is a format introduced by Microsoft for XML-based vectorial documents.</li><li>"<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;DisplayLang=en">Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats</a>". Need to view and edit an MS Office document which is in the Open Document format (AKA: "Office 2007 format"), but you have an older version of MS Office. Install this add-in and there you go.</li></ul>Until next, may you enjoy adding things.
