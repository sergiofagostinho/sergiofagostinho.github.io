It appears that the Windows Azure emulator that comes with <a href="http://blog.ehuna.org/2011/02/how_to_fix_the_error_the_commu.html" target="_blank">Windows Azure SDK doesn't like services with the Web.config file with the read-only attribute</a>. It happens that that's&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;what SourceSafe and TFS do when a file is not checked-out. Do these guys work in the same company? Or does the Azure team use Subversion and git? ;)<br /><br /><i>Note: this is basically a <a href="http://pontonetpt.org/blogs/labs2/archive/2011/06/07/dores-em-azure.aspx" target="_blank">repost from my previous blog</a>.</i>
