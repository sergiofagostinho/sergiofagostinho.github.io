This is one of the features I was missing from Community Server (and previous versions of Blogger): static pages. I've added two useful pages. The first one links to libraries that at some point I've used and recommend (currently only .NET and Silverlight, but eventually I might extend it to include JavaScript). It includes the license to know whether you can use on your project. The second one links to&nbsp;auxiliary&nbsp;tools that a developer should keep at hand.
