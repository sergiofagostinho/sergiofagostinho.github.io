I've recently started working professionally on Java and I would like to blog about it in the near future. As such, it makes on sense to create (yet) another blog, so I decided to rename this blog to "Sergio Agostinho <b>Dev</b>". This means I'll also rename the site URL to <a href="http://sergioagostinho-dev.blogspot.com/">http://sergioagostinho-dev.blogspot.com</a> Yes, this will break existing links and will not benefit the blog SEO, but it's a change I would have to do, sooner of later.
