Earlier this year, I attended the MSc discussion of <a href="http://ptsoft.net/tdd/">Tiago Dias</a>, entitled "Hyper/Net: MDSoC support for .NET". The thesis explored Multi-Dimensional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concerns</a> (MDSoc) for the .NET platform, namely using the C# programming language. The idea is based <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/hyperspace/HyperJ/HyperJ.htm">Hyper/J</a>, a research project abandoned by IBM a couple of years ago. While this may same like a bad start, Tiago's presentation was very good and convincing. Essentially, the MDSoC support is based on .NET's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_type">partial classes</a> and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_programming">generative programming</a> techniques. This work originated a research paper, with the same name of the dissertation, published in 2006. Also, some of the dissertation's chapters were stripped, as they belong on a possible future PhD thesis. These chapters dealt with the cognitive aspects of the multidimensional separation of concerns.<br /><br />Until next time, may you enjoy separating concerns, one way or the other.
