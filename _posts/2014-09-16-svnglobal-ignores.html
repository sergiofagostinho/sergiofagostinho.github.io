After struggling for some time in making sure that the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">svn:ignore</span>property is applied recursively, I've recently realized that <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.8.html#repos-dictated-config">Subversion 1.8.x introduced</a> the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">svn:global-ignores</span>, which makes sure you just need to set a property in the root folder.<br />It uses the same values as <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">svn:ignore</span>, and will work mixed with it (values are appended). By the way, currently TortoiseSVN (v 1.8.7) doesn't work at 100% (not all folders and files are ignored in the first commit), but probably it will be fixed in the future.
