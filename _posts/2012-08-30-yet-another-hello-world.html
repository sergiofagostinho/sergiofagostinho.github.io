<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here is my third blog on software development. Unlike my previous&nbsp;instalments, "Labs" @ XAML-PT and "Labs 2" @ pontoNETpt, this is not&nbsp;dependent on any community, nor will be in&nbsp;Portuguese. Nor it will be called "Labs 3", just my name and where my work mostly is around - .NET. It's a better choice for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> purposes :) In terms of content, this will mostly follow "Labs 2", basically logging my experiments and issue fixing, in case I might need it in the future, and in the hope that it might&nbsp;useful&nbsp;for someone else.<br />Regarding my previous blogging, XAML-PT is lost and pontoNETpt is currently down, although it is expected to be up again in the near future (<a href="http://pontonetpt.org/blogs/labs2/default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>). My old entries on my&nbsp;personal&nbsp;blog regarding .NET are still available <a href="http://sergioag.blogspot.pt/search/label/.Net" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;(in&nbsp;Portuguese).</span>
