Today I found peculiar issue while doing SQL scripts...<br /><br />A couple of months ago, I did an SQL script that, among other things had an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176072.aspx" target="_blank">ALTER TRIGGER</a> statement followed by an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177523.aspx" target="_blank">UPDATE</a> statement. This particular trigger was&nbsp;supposed&nbsp;to add data to a history table. For some strange reason though, I was having trouble doing a particular update statement, because it was&nbsp;being&nbsp;undone. After a couple of hours, I found the cultrip: there was an update statement <i>inside</i> the trigger. What happened? I didn't do a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188037.aspx" target="_blank">GO</a> statement between the trigger and the update statement.<br />(Yeah, maybe this is obvious for all the SQL gurus out there, but it was not for me. Lesson learnt. :))<br /><br /><br />
