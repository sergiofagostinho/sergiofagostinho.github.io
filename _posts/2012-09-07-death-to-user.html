A couple months ago, one of my VS solutions would just crash with a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;project. After a couple of hours, I've found the solution: close Visual Studio, delete all the "*.csproj.user" files, and reload the solution. My theory is that this was caused by TFS merges, since this solution had a few dozen&nbsp;projects&nbsp;and was&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;updated by various users, which in turn caused frequent conflicts. It's no wonder that these files are listed in <a href="http://sergioagostinho-net.blogspot.pt/2012/09/gitignore-for-visual-studio-2010.html" target="_blank">.gitignore</a>.<br /><br /><i>Note: this is basically a <a href="http://pontonetpt.org/blogs/labs2/archive/2011/04/06/morte-ao-user.aspx" target="_blank">repost from my previous blog</a>.</i>
